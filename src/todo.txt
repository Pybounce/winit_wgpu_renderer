- If on windows and can pick between vulkan and dx, pick dx. 
    On vulkan, resizing the window lags quit a bit and looks bad
- Split out window.rs into different files?

Notes:
- AMD drivers don't seem to have transparency



SDF Rendering:
- ttf files contain (at their core) a fuck load of bezier curves
- we can generate an algorithm to turn that into an SDF
- depending on the speed of this, we will likely have to cache the sdf output as a texture or some other format
    - rather than running it each re-render
- from there we can do a lot of good stuff, but first the algo.
